            <h2>Server Rules</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Do not ask for Mod unless you meet the qualifications. You can't be a Mod if you haven't even bothered to read the rules.</li>
                <li>Client mods are allowed only if they do not alter gameplay and are in good spirit with the game. For example, maps and graphical mods are allowed, but flying and hack clients are not. When in doubt ask a Mod.</li>
                <li>Any attempt to cheat/hack will be swiftly rewarded with a permaban. This includes exploiting bugs on the server that obviously shouldn't be there. Please report these issues to a Mod immediately.</li>
                <li>There is absolutely NO GRIEFING in Sigby.</li>
                <li>Scippe is unprotected and free-for-all. Protect yourself and your things at all times.</li>
                <li>Use common sense and be respectful. We are all here to have fun, and the Mods are here to help make the server a good place for everyone.</li>
            </ol>
            </br>
